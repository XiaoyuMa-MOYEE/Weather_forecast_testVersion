res_humidity() : Returns the current humidity(the example value is 60%).

Dictionary mapping (response_mapping) :

A keyword in a dictionary is a keyword that may appear in a question, such as "Umbrella", "weather", "clothing", etc.

The value (handler) is the processing function that matches these keywords. For example, when the user mentions "umbrella", the res_pop() function is called to return the suggestion of whether an umbrella is needed.

get_weather_response(question) Input processing function:

Traversing the dictionary: This function traverses the response_mapping dictionary to check if the problem contains the key words in the dictionary. If matching keywords are found, the corresponding processing function will be called.

Regular expression matching: Use re.search() to check whether the user input contains the keywords in the dictionary. s?  Used for handling singular and plural forms, re.IGNORECASE ensures case insensitivity.

User question: In the questions list, we simulated several common weather-related questions.

Output example:

Question: Do I need to take an umbrella?
Answer: It's going to rain today. It's recommended to take an umbrella.
------------------------------
Question: What's the weather like?
Answer: The weather today is sunny.
------------------------------

Summary:

You can easily expand and match more weather-related questions through dictionary mapping and regular expressions.

Each keyword corresponds to a processing function, which generates appropriate responses based on the keywords input by the user.

Using regular expressions and dictionary mappings can make the code more concise, flexible and easy to expand.

You said:
As your answer shows, the key words "umbrella", "rain", "precipitation", "wet", "showers", "rainy", "storms", and "need an umbrella" can all correspond to the res_pop function. Please re-provide the dictionary based on this logic
ChatGPT said:

Understood! According to the logic you provided, multiple key words (such as umbrella, rain, precipitation, wet, showers, rainy, storms, need an umbrella) can all be mapped to the same processing function (res_pop). We can integrate these key words into the dictionary mapping and call the corresponding processing functions by matching multiple key words through regular expressions.

Explanation:

response_mapping dictionary:

For all the key words related to umbrellas (such as umbrella, rain, precipitation, wet, showers, rainy, storms, need an umbrella), we map them all to the same processing function res_pop.

Other weather-related keywords (such as weather, clothing, temperature, wind, humidity) are still mapped to their respective processing functions respectively.

Regular expression:

re.search(r"\b" + re.escape(keyword) + r"s?\b", question, re.IGNORECASE) ensures that multiple relevant keywords are case-insensitive matched in the questions entered by the user.

s?  Both singular and plural forms can be matched. For example, "umbrella" and "umbrellas" will match.

The get_weather_response() function:

This function traverses the response_mapping dictionary and checks whether each keyword appears in the user's question. If matching keywords are found, the corresponding processing function will be called.

User question:

We tested the system through several common weather-related issues, including carrying an umbrella, weather, temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.

Output example:

Question: Do I need to take an umbrella?
Answer: It's going to rain today. It's recommended to take an umbrella.
------------------------------
Question: Is it going to rain today?
Answer: It's going to rain today. It's recommended to take an umbrella.
------------------------------

Summary:

By mapping multiple weather-related keywords to the same processing function, your code becomes more concise and flexible.

Using regular expressions to handle singular and plural forms and case-insensitive matching enables the system to better understand user questions and provide corresponding answers.

You said:
I have 5 functions. If one function corresponds to 10 keywords, I need to provide 50 dictionaries. Is there a more optimized way to combine the keywords of the same function
ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can merge multiple keywords by optimizing the dictionary mapping structure instead of providing separate entries for each keyword. By combining multiple related keyword groups into a list and using any one of these lists for matching, you can greatly simplify the code and dictionary structure.
Optimization plan: Use the list in the dictionary to organize the keywords

You can map each processing function to a list containing multiple keywords instead of writing a separate dictionary entry for each keyword. In this way, each function only needs to correspond to one entry and can be matched among multiple keywords through re.search().
Improved code example:

import re

# Define processing functions
def res_pop():
"It's raining today. It's recommended to take an umbrella." # Determine whether an umbrella is needed based on the precipitation conditions

def res_describe_weather():
"Today's weather is sunny." # Return the weather description

def res_clothing():
return: "It's warm today. It is recommended to wear light clothes." # Dressing suggestions based on temperature

def res_temperature():
"The temperature today is 22°C." # Return Current Temperature (Example)

def res_wind():
return: "The wind speed today is 10 km/h." # Return Current Wind Speed (Example)

def res_humidity():
return: "The humidity is 60% today." # Return Current Humidity (Example)

# Mapping Dictionary of Questions and Responses
response_mapping = {
Each processing function corresponds to multiple keywords (which can be a list).
res_pop: ["umbrella", "rain", "precipitation", "wet", "showers", "rainy", "storms", "need an umbrella"],
res_describe_weather: ["weather", "forecast", "how's the weather", "what's the weather like"],

Explanation:

response_mapping dictionary:

In the dictionary, each processing function (such as res_pop, res_describe_weather, res_clothing, etc.) corresponds to multiple keywords. Each key (res_pop, res_describe_weather, etc.) is mapped to a list of keywords. This list contains multiple related keywords. When matching these keywords, the corresponding processing functions will be called.

For example, the keyword list corresponding to res_pop includes "umbrella", "rain", "precipitation", etc., and they all correspond to the same processing function.

The get_weather_response() function:

Traverse each handler and the corresponding list of keywords in the dictionary. For each processing function, further traverse its keyword list and use the regular expression re.search() to check whether a certain keyword is contained in the problem.

If a matching keyword is found, call the processing function and return its result. If no matching keywords are found, a default "Sorry" message will be returned.

re.search() :

Use regular expressions for matching, and re.IGNORECASE ensures case-insensitive, s? Indicates matching the singular and plural forms. For example, both "umbrella" and "umbrellas" match.

Advantages:

Simplify the dictionary structure: You no longer need to create a separate dictionary entry for each keyword. Each processing function only needs to appear once in the dictionary and can handle multiple keywords through a list.

Good scalability: If you want to add more keywords to a certain function, you only need to add new keywords in the corresponding list without modifying the dictionary structure.

High maintainability: All keywords related to a certain function are integrated together, making the code more concise and easy to maintain.

Output example:

Question: Do I need to take an umbrella?
Answer: It's going to rain today. It's recommended to take an umbrella.
------------------------------
Question: Is it going to rain today?
Answer: It's going to rain today. It's recommended to take an umbrella.
------------------------------
Question: How wet is it outside?
Answer: It's going to rain today. It's recommended to take an umbrella.
------------------------------
Question: Will there be showers today?
Answer: It's going to rain today. It's recommended to take an umbrella.
------------------------------
Question: How's the weather today?
Answer: The weather today is sunny.
------------------------------
Question: What should I wear today?
Answer: It's warm today. It is recommended to wear light clothes.
------------------------------
Question: What is the temperature today?
Answer: The temperature today is 22°C.
------------------------------
Question: How windy is it today?
Answer: The wind speed is 10 km/h today.
------------------------------
Question: How humid is it today?
Answer: The humidity is 60% today.
------------------------------

Summary:

Dictionary optimization: By mapping multiple keywords to the same processing function, we avoid duplicate dictionary entries and simplify the code structure.

Easy to expand and maintain: New keywords can be easily added to the existing function list without making significant modifications to the entire dictionary structure.
