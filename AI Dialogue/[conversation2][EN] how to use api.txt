How can I obtain data using the API key
ChatGPT said:

You have obtained the API key of OpenWeatherMap. Now, you just need to add it to the request parameters and you can access the weather data through Python.

The following are the complete steps and code examples to enable you to correctly request and obtain weather forecast data with the key.
‚úÖ Step 1: Prepare your API Key

Suppose the key you get is:

1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

‚úÖ Step 2: Use the key in Python

You need to add this key to the appid parameter of the API request.
‚úÖ Sample code (get 5-day forecast)

import requests
from collections import defaultdict

def get_weather_forecast(city, api_key):
Url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast"
params = {
"q": city, # city name
"appid": api_key, # Your API Key
"units": "metric", # using degrees Celsius ("imperial" indicates degrees Fahrenheit)
"lang": "zh_cn" # Chinese weather description
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params)
data = response.json()

# Check whether the request is successful
if response.status_code ! = 200:
print(" Request Failed :", data.get("message", "Unknown error "))
return

# Extract the data from noon every day (12:00)
forecast_by_day = defaultdict(list)
for item in data["list"]:
dt_txt = item["dt_txt"]
date = dt_txt.split(" ")[0]
temp = item["main"]["temp"]
description = item["weather"][0]["description"]
forecast_by_day[date].append((dt_txt, temp, description))

print(f" city: {data['city']['name']}\n")
for date, entries in list(forecast_by_day.items())[:5]: # Display for a maximum of 5 days
Take the one at 12 noon or the first one as an alternative
mid = next((e for e in entries if "12:00" in e[0]), entries[0])
print(f"{date} : {mid[2]}, {mid[1]}¬∞C")

How to use ‚úÖ :

api_key = "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
get_weather_forecast("Beijing", api_key)

‚úÖ Step 3 (recommended) : Store the API Key in the.env file (for better security)
Create the.env file:

OWM_API_KEY=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

Install python-dotenv:

pip install python-dotenv

Modify the Python code:

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("OWM_API_KEY")

Then call get_weather_forecast("Beijing", api_key) as usual
‚úÖ Common Error troubleshooting
Possible causes of error messages
401 Unauthorized API key error or not activated
404 Not Found. The city name is misspelled or does not exist
429 Too Many Requests. The request frequency exceeds the limit (60 times per minute for free)
Network request failure, local network failure, spelling mistakes, etc

If you have prepared the API key, you can also tell me which city you want to query. I can help you test the format of the returned data. Do you need me to help you encapsulate a version that returns JSON or table structure?

What is the env file
ChatGPT said:

Very good question!

The.env file is a small text file used for storing environment variables and is usually used to save sensitive information, such as:

API key (such as OWM_API_KEY=xxx)

Database username and password

Project configuration parameters (such as operation mode, path)

‚úÖ Why.env file?
Description of Advantages
Security avoids directly exposing API keys in the code
It is convenient for centralized management of maintenance configuration, facilitating multi-person collaboration or deployment
The local, test and production environments can be distinguished, each using different configurations
It is suitable for version control. The.env file does not need to be uploaded to Git to prevent key leakage
Example of the üìù.env file

You can create a text file named the.env, and the content is as follows:

OWM_API_KEY=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=MySecretPassword

‚ö†Ô∏è File name must be.env, without extension!
‚úÖ How to use.env file in Python

You need to use the python-dotenv library to read the variables in the.env file.
üîß Installation library:

pip install python-dotenv

üîç Sample code:

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load the variables in the.env file
load_dotenv()

# Obtain a certain environment variable
api_key = os.getenv("OWM_API_KEY")

print(f" Your API Key is: {api_key}")

üìÅ Project structure example:

my_weather_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ.env ‚Üê stores API keys
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt

The.env file is not uploaded to GitHub by default. Just add it in the.gitignore:

.env

‚úÖ Summary
Answer to the question
What does.env do? Used to store sensitive or configurable parameters, such as API keys
Is it necessary to use it? Not mandatory, but recommended, especially when it comes to key or multi-environment deployment
How to read? Read it using the load_dotenv() of python-dotenv

Do you need my help?

Create the.env file and fill in your key?

Write a complete code template for reading.env?

How to use the env file in the.ipynb file
ChatGPT said:

Very good! You can use the.env file completely properly in the.ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook), and the method is the same as in the.py file. It only requires two steps:
‚úÖ Step 1: Install python-dotenv

If you haven't installed this library yet, run it in the first code unit of Notebook:

! pip install python-dotenv

‚úÖ Step 2: Load the.env file into your Notebook

In your project directory (that is, the directory the.ipynb is located), create a file named the.env and write the following content (such as your API key) :

OWM_API_KEY=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

Then add the following code in the Notebook:

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load the.env file
load_dotenv()

# Obtain the API key
api_key = os.getenv("OWM_API_KEY")

print(" Your API Key is: ", api_key)

‚úÖ Overall Notebook example

# Step 1: Install Dependencies (Just the first time)
! pip install python-dotenv

# Step 2: Load the.env and read the variable
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("OWM_API_KEY")

# Step 3: Make the request using this key
import requests

city = "Beijing"
Url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast"
params = {
"q": city,
"appid": api_key,
"units": "metric",
"lang": "zh_cn"
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params)
data = response.json()

# Simply output the first result
if response.status_code == 200:
print(data["list"][0])
else:
print(" Request Failed :", data.get("message", "Unknown error "))

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
Problem Description
The path of the.env file must be in the same directory as the.ipynb file, or pass an absolute path
Can variable names have Spaces? ‚ùå No, it must be KEY=VALUE format
Will the key be exposed? As long as the api_key is not printed out, it will not be exposed

Do you need me to generate a complete.env + Notebook project template for you? Or help you add error handling and caching?
