Suppose my function A contains two sub-functions B and C. Function A acquires A large amount of data through an API, and both of these sub-functions will use the data from A. Then, after I call B, if I call C again, will I still access the API again
ChatGPT said:

Very good question! This is actually related to core concepts such as function scope, data passing, and caching.
✅ Briefly answer:

Whether the API will be accessed again depends on how you design the A function and handle the data.

If the A() you wrote requests the API and returns data every time it is called, while B() and C() obtain data by calling A() again, then of course the requests will be repeated.
✅ Correct approach (avoid duplicate requests to the API)

You can cache the data obtained by the API, request it only once, and then pass it to B() and C() :
✅ Recommended Structure 1: Return data → Manually pass parameters to B and C

def A():
# Request the API only once
response = requests.get(...)
data = response.json()
return data # Return data to the outside

def B(data):
# Analyze using data
...

def C(data):
# Visualize using the same data
...

# Main calling logic
weather_data = A()
B(weather_data)
C(weather_data)

✅ Recommended Structure 2: Function A calls B and C (no repeated requests)

def A():
data = requests.get(...) .json()
B(data)
C(data)

def B(data):
...

def C(data):
...

❌ Not recommended practice (will repeat requests)

def A():
return requests.get(...) .json()

def B():
data = A() # ❗ requested again
...

def C():
data = A() # ❗ request again
...

# Two calls trigger the API respectively
B()
C()

✅ Additional suggestion: Use cache (Advanced)

You can also enable the A function to have an internal cache:

_cached_data = None

def A():
global _cached_data
if _cached_data is None:
_cached_data = requests.get(...) .json()
return _cached_data

In this way, even if A() is called multiple times, only the first time will a request be initiated.
✅ Summary
Whether the situation is a duplicate request
data = A() → passed to B, C ❌ not
Each time A() is called, it is passed to the subfunction ✅
Using the internal cache ❌ won't

Do you need me to help you encapsulate an automatically cached API call function? Which ones support timeout and forced refresh?
You said:
If my function X has two return values A and B, and I want to pass B into the Y function, how can I obtain it
ChatGPT said:

Very good. This involves the multi-return value unpack mechanism of Python functions, which is very common.
✅ Suppose the structure is as follows:

def X():
A = "This is A"
B = "This is B"
return A, B

You only want to pass B into another function Y() now. You can do it like this:
✅ Method 1: Ignore A and take B by underlining _

_, B = X()
Y(B)

Here, the "_" indicates "I don't care about this return value".
✅ Method 2: Receive all, then select to send

A, B = X()
Y(B)

✅ Method 3: Pass in directly (without explicit naming)

Y(X()[1]) # The first return value is A, and the index is 0; The second one is B, with an index of 1

Although it is the shortest written, its readability is poor and it is not recommended for use in complex scenarios.
✅ Sample full demonstration:

def X():
return "Weather Overview ", {"temp": 24, "humidity": 70}

def Y(data):
print(" The content received by the Y function is: ", data)

# Call
_, b_data = X()
Y(b_data)

Output:

The content received by the Y function is: {'temp': 24, 'humidity': 70}

Do you need me to help you encapsulate a function structure that specifically returns multiple results? Or make a chained call in Jupyter Notebook?

Encapsulate this code into a function and return a list of data
ChatGPT said:

Sure! The following is the standard way to encapsulate your logic into a function:
✅ The encapsulated function definition

from collections import defaultdict

def group_weather_by_day(data):
"" "
Based on the data returned by the OpenWeatherMap API, extract and group four types of weather elements by date:
Temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation probability.

Parameter:
data: The complete JSON dictionary object returned by the API (which should contain the "list" key)

Return:
Four defaultdict: temperature_by_day, wind_by_day, humidity_by_day, and pop_by_day
"" "
forecast_data = data["list"]

# Initialize the result dictionary
temperature_by_day = defaultdict(list)
wind_by_day = defaultdict(list)
humidity_by_day = defaultdict(list)
pop_by_day = defaultdict(list)

# Traverse each 3-hour data block
for item in forecast_data:
dt_txt = item["dt_txt"]                  # e.g., "2025-05-22 12:00:00"
date = dt_txt.split(" ")[0]              # e.g., "2025-05-22"
temp = item["main"]["temp"]
wind = item["wind"]["speed"]
humidity = item["main"]["humidity"]
pop = item.get("pop", 0) # Precipitation probability, the default value is 0

# Add to your respective daily lists
temperature_by_day[date].append((dt_txt, temp))
wind_by_day[date].append((dt_txt, wind))
humidity_by_day[date].append((dt_txt, humidity))
pop_by_day[date].append((dt_txt, round(pop * 100))) # percentage

return temperature_by_day, wind_by_day, humidity_by_day, pop_by_day

✅ Usage:

# Suppose you have already obtained the API return data as Data
temp_by_day, wind_by_day, hum_by_day, pop_by_day = group_weather_by_day(data)

# Sample Output
for date, values in temp_by_day.items():
print(f"{date} temperature record: ")
for time, temp in values:
print(f" {time} : {temp}°C")

If further expansion is needed, such as calculating the average value by day, maximum and minimum values, chart display, or saving as a CSV file, it can also be further encapsulated. Do you need me to help you add the daily average temperature or draw the chart?

# Organize the weather data for every three hours by day

This is the source code I obtained from the weather. I want to add additional data to the return list on the basis of the current return value remaining unchanged
ChatGPT said:

Understood! Your current code has already:

Summarize the data of the weather for the next five days, mainly at noon each day, as result["forecast"]

A concise daily weather summary has been returned

Now you hope to return more detailed original data of forecast_by_day groups (including one every 3 hours) additionally without changing this return structure.
✅ Modify the objective:

The original function returns:

return result

You hope to become:

return result, forecast_by_day

✅ can be modified as follows:

You just need to add a sentence at the end of the function:

return result, forecast_by_day

✅ Full illustration after modification:

def get_forecast(data, max_day=5):
# Organize the weather data for every three hours by day
forecast_by_day = defaultdict(list)
for item in data["list"]:
date = item["dt_txt"].split(" ")[0]
temp = item["main"]["temp"]
desc = item["weather"][0]["description"]
speed = item["wind"]["speed"]
humidity = item["main"]["humidity"]
pop = item.get("pop", 0)
time = item["dt_txt"]
forecast_by_day[date].append((time, temp, desc, speed, humidity, pop))

# Build summaries mainly based on 12:00 every day
result = {
"city": data["city"]["name"],
"forecast": []
}
for date, items in list(forecast_by_day.items())[:max_day]:
mid = next((x for x in items if "12:00" in x[0]), items[0])
Date of print (f ": {date}, weather conditions: {mid [2]}, the temperature: {mid [1]} ° C, wind speed: {mid [3]}, humidity: {mid [4]}, precipitation rate: {mid [5]}")
result["forecast"].append({
"date": date,
"time": mid[0],
"temperature": mid[1],
"description": mid[2],
"speed": mid[3],
"humidity": mid[4],
"pop": mid[5]
})

return result, forecast_by_day

✅ Usage:

# Call the function and receive two return values
summary, detailed_by_day = get_forecast(data)

# summary is the original result (city and daily summary)
# detailed_by_day is a detailed list for every 3 hours every day

Would you like me to help you transform the structure of forecast_by_day into a form that is more suitable for the front end /JSON, such as:

{
"2025-05-18":
{"time": "..." , "temp": ... , "desc": ... , "speed": ... , "humidity": ... , "pop": ... },
...
]
}

I can provide you with the JSON-ready format conversion function. Is it necessary?
