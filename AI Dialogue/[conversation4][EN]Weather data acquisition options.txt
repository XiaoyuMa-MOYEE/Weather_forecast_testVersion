I'm working on a weather forecast project. I have some data sources now. Please compare their advantages and disadvantages:
WeatherWrapper module
wttr.in service API
OpenWeatherMap or similar
ChatGPT said:

Choosing the appropriate data source in the weather forecast project is very crucial. Different data interfaces have different advantages and disadvantages. The following is a comparative analysis of the three data sources you mentioned, covering accuracy, ease of use, functionality, limitations and applicable scenarios:
🔹 1. WeatherWrapper module

This is a third-party library or module (usually a library in python, such as Python-weather, etc.) that encapsulates multiple weather apis. It does not provide data by itself but invokes other services.
✅ Advantages:

Unified interface: Uniformly encapsulate the apis of multiple weather services, with concise code.

Easy to switch back ends: It can quickly switch from one data source to another (such as OpenWeather, WeatherAPI).

Usually, the documents are clear and easy to get started with.

❌ Disadvantages:

Reliance on external services: The actual data quality and frequency depend on the underlying API (for example, OpenWeather might still be used).

Maintenance risks: Third-party modules may not be updated in a timely manner, and the usage methods of API keys are inconsistent.

Functional limitations: Only encapsulated functions are provided, with slightly lower flexibility.

✅ is suitable for:

For beginners or rapid prototyping, it is suitable for those who do not want to deeply control the format of data requests.
🔹 2. wttr.in API

This is a terminal-style weather interface service, which can obtain the weather in text format through HTTP requests (and can also return JSON).
✅ Advantages:

Extremely concise: One command, curl wttr.in/beijing, can obtain the weather.

Free and no registration required: No API Key needed.

Support JSON format output: such as wttr.in/beijing? format=j1.

An interesting visual style, suitable for CLI projects.

❌ Disadvantages:

Limited functions: Does not support complex weather forecasts (such as minutem-level, radar maps, etc.).

Not suitable for business or high-frequency requests: It is recommended in the document not to access frequently.

The returned data has format limitations and is not the best representative of a structured API.

✅ is suitable for:

Quick display, command-line tools, educational purposes or low-frequency weather inquiries.
🔹 3. OpenWeatherMap API (or similar service)

This is a professional weather data provision platform that supports both free and paid plans and has relatively comprehensive functions.
✅ Advantages:

High customizability: Supports current weather, hourly forecasts, historical data, air quality, etc.

Structured data: Returns JSON for easy parsing and secondary processing.

It has rich documentation, a wide community and is supported by many open source projects.

There are free quotas (such as 60 times per day or once per minute).

❌ Disadvantages:

Registration and acquisition of the API Key are required.

The free version has limitations: such as request frequency and predicted days.

Data quality depends on the region: Some remote areas may not be accurate.

✅ is suitable for:

Formal products, mobile apps, Web projects, or developers who need stable apis.
📊 Summary comparison table:
Features: WeatherWrapper Module wttr.in API OpenWeatherMap API
The usage threshold is extremely low (curl is fine) (registration is required)
Data quality depends on the (more simplified) high (professional data source) in the encapsulated source.
The richness of functions is medium to low and high
The request format is simplified and encapsulated (possibly JSON) : text/JSON/XML
Real-time performance and predictive capabilities depend on the support of the back-end API, but they are stronger than the basic ones (minute-level and hour-level).
Applicable scenarios include prototype design, command-line tools for teaching projects, small script commercial projects, apps, and platform services
✅

Rapid development, learning or prototyping: Use wttr.in or WeatherWrapper.

For medium and large-scale projects that require various weather data, OpenWeatherMap or other professional services (such as WeatherAPI, ClimaCell) should be selected.

If you have requirements for stability and scalability, OpenWeatherMap is more suitable and can be combined with WeatherWrapper to take advantage of its encapsulation.

Do you need me to write a simple weather inquiry demo for you? Would you like to use Python or JavaScript?
You said:
Please provide the detailed usage of wttr
ChatGPT said:

Ok. Below is the detailed usage of wttr.in, including request format, parameters, output format, language selection, restriction descriptions, etc. It is very suitable for command-line tools, simple Web projects or learning purposes.
🌦️ wttr.in basics

wttr.in is a command-line weather service that can obtain weather information through curl or browser requests. It uses WeGo and the Weather API to provide weather data and supports multiple output formats (text, graphics, JSON).
✅ 1. Basic usage
🌐 is directly accessed by a browser:

https://wttr.in/Beijing

The 💻 command line is used (curl or wget is recommended) :

curl wttr.in/Beijing

By default, it returns the English ASCII graphic weather forecast (within 3 days).
✅ 2. Common parameter usage
📌 2.1 City or Location Designation

Support the following ways to input the location name:

curl wttr.in/beijing
curl wttr.in/tokyo
curl wttr.in/"New York"
curl wttr.in/[@location]

Support IP automatic location, for example:

curl wttr.in

📌 2.2 Control Language display

Support multiple languages, such as Chinese (zh). Add: after the URL

curl wttr.in/Beijing? lang=zh

Other common language codes:

zh: Chinese

en: English

ja: Japanese

ru: Russian

de: German

📌 2.3 Output format Control
👁️ Simple custom format (?) format=)

Can you use it? format= returns specific information, for example:

curl wttr.in/Beijing? format="%l:+%c+%t"

Display:

Beijing: ☀️ +24°C

Common format symbols:
Symbol meaning
Position %l
%c Weather icon (emoji)
%t Current temperature
%h Humidity
Wind speed %w
%C Weather description (such as Sunny)

Can you use it too? format=j1 to obtain the structured JSON output:

curl wttr.in/beijing? format=j1

📌 2.4 Enforce terminal style or picture style

? T forces terminal ASCII style (without graphic framework)

? m uses metric units (℃, km/h)

? u uses imperial units (℉, mph)

Example:

curl wttr.in/beijing? m&lang=zh

📌 2.5 shows forecast for the coming days

The default display is 3 days and it can be switched.

curl wttr.in/beijing? 3 # 3 days
curl wttr.in/beijing? 2 # 2 days
curl wttr.in/beijing? Just today

⚠️ 3. Notes (Official recommendations)

Frequent requests are not recommended (it is suggested to be less than 10 times per minute).

Free service, no guarantee of continuous stability (suitable for lightweight projects or learning).

For complex projects, please consider using professional apis (such as OpenWeatherMap).

🧪 Example combination usage

# Chinese + Metric units + 2-day forecast + Mandatory text format
curl wttr.in/beijing? lang=zh&m&2

# Obtain data in JSON format
curl wttr.in/beijing? format=j1

# Get emoji Weather
curl wttr.in/beijing? format="%l:+%c+%t+%C+%w"

If you have specific requirements (such as obtaining the temperature and wind speed of a certain city and drawing a graph), I can help you write a complete script. Are you going to use Python or Shell?
You said:
If I plan to use python, how can I obtain data
ChatGPT said:

If you plan to obtain wttr.in data using Python, you can make API requests through the requests library and parse the returned data. The following are some specific steps and code examples:
1. Install dependencies

First of all, you need to ensure that the requests library is installed. If it has not been installed yet, you can install it using pip:

pip install requests

2. Obtain data and analyze it
🌦️ Get simple weather data

import requests

# City Name
city = "Beijing"

# Send a GET request
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? format=%l:+%c+%t+%C+%w')

# Output the response content
print(response.text)

🌟 Example results

The output will be like this:

Beijing: ☀️ +24°C Sunny 3 km/h

🌦️ Get the weather data in JSON format

If you need structured data (such as JSON), you can do it like this:

import requests

# City Name
city = "Beijing"

# Obtain JSON data
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? format=j1')

# Convert the responded JSON data to a Python dictionary
data = response.json()

# Output the returned data
print(data)

3. Obtain more detailed weather data

You can customize the format as needed to obtain different types of information:

%l: Location (City name)

%c: Current weather icon (emoji)

%t: Temperature (unit determined by format)

%C: Weather description (such as sunny day, cloudy day)

%w: Wind speed

If you need to obtain the weather data for the next few days, you can use code similar to the following:

import requests

# City Name
city = "Beijing"

# Get the weather data for the next 3 days
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? 3&format=%l:+%c+%t+%C+%w')

# Output the weather data for the next three days
print(response.text)

4. Error Handling

You can also add some error handling in case the request fails (such as network issues or invalid city names) :

import requests

# City Name
city = "Beijing"

try:
# Send Request
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? format=j1')

# Check the response status code
response.raise_for_status()

# Parse JSON data
data = response.json()
print(data)

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
print(f" Request failed: {e}")

5. Optional: Custom output format

If you need more detailed weather information, you can customize the format parameter of the request. For example, obtain the temperature and wind speed:

import requests

city = "Beijing"

# Custom Output format: Obtain temperature and wind speed
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? format="%t+%w"')

# Output
print(response.text)

6. Use language Settings

If you wish to return in Chinese or other languages, simply add? In the request. lang=zh:

import requests

city = "Beijing"

# Get Chinese weather data
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? lang=zh&format="%l:+%c+%t"')

# Output Chinese weather information
print(response.text)

Summary:

Use requests.get() to send HTTP requests.

The returned data content can be customized through different format parameters.

The returned data can be in simple text or JSON format.

In the command line, wttr.in can be used to obtain quick weather forecast information. Python acquires and processes data through requests.

Hope these codes can help you! If you have any other questions or need further optimization, please let me know at any time!
You said:
When I attempted to obtain the data of the last three days, the code was as follows:
import requests


def test_of_data():
city = "Beijing"
# Send a GET request
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? 3&format=%l:+%c+%t+%C+%w')
# %l: Address
# %c: Current weather icon
# %t: Temperature
# %C: Weather description
# %w: Wind speed
# Output the response content
print(response.text)
But the content of my return is only one line
Beijing: 🌦 +12°C Light rain ←13km/h
ChatGPT said:

The reason why you can only see one line of result is that the URL you requested:

https://wttr.in/Beijing?3&format=%l:+%c+%t+%C+%w

"format=..." was used in it. The parameter will force the return of a one-line summary data in a custom format instead of multi-day forecasts.
✅ The correct way to get weather for the next three days
Method 1: Remove format=... Parameters: Use the default text format of wttr.in

import requests

def test_of_data():
city = "Beijing"
# Remove the format parameter and only retain the 3-day parameter
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? 3&lang=zh&m')
print(response.text)

This will return a terminal-style three-day weather ASCII table, similar to this:

Weather report: Beijing

\   /     Partly cloudy
.-.      +17°C
― (   ) ―   ↑13 km/h
0.0mm
/ \ 58%

... (Information for the following two days

Method Two: Use structured JSON data (recommended for processing by Python programs)

import requests
import json

def test_json_weather():
city = "Beijing"
response = requests.get(f'https://wttr.in/{city}? format=j1')
data = response.json()

# Access the data for the next three days
for day in data['weather']:
date = day['date']
maxtemp = day['maxtempC']
mintemp = day['mintempC']
description = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value'] # Noon weather
print(f"{date}: {description}, {mintemp}°C ~ {maxtemp}°C")

Output example (structured) :

2025-05-09: Light rain, 12°C ~ 18°C
2025-05-10: Cloudy, 14°C ~ 22°C
2025-05-11: Sunny, 16°C ~ 25°C

🔧 Notes

? 3 tells wttr to return the content of 3 days, but it is only valid when there are no formatting parameters (otherwise, only one line will be returned).

? format=...  It is a customized output parameter that will overwrite the default display behavior of the number of days.

If you need to program to obtain information for multiple days, it is recommended to use JSON format (? format=j1), which is easier to handle and extract.

Do you need me to help you write a version of the visual weather chart?
You said:
Then I won't use it? In the case of 3, how can the data of the specified predicted number of days be obtained
ChatGPT said:

Very good question! Can't you pass in wttr.in? format=...  Or? 3 to directly obtain the data of the specified number of days (such as the second or third day), unless you use the structured JSON format (?) format=j1). This is currently the only way to obtain detailed daily weather data.
✅ Correct way: Use? format=j1 to obtain multi-day data and then extract it as needed

import requests

def get_forecast(city):
url = f"https://wttr.in/{city}? format=j1"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

# Get the weather for the next 3 days
for day in data['weather']:
date = day['date']
max_temp = day['maxtempC']
min_temp = day['mintempC']
description = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value'] # Noon weather
print(f"{date}: {description}, {min_temp}°C ~ {max_temp}°C")

🔍 Introduction to JSON Data Structures (Part) :

{
"weather": [
{
"date": "2025-05-09",
"maxtempC": "25",
"mintempC": "15",
"hourly": [
{
"time": "0",
"weatherDesc": [{"value": "Clear"}],
...
},
...
{
"time": "1200",
"weatherDesc": [{"value": "Sunny"}],
...
}
]
},
...
]
}

✅ Get the data of day a custom

You can obtain the weather data of the NTH day by indexing data['weather'][n] :

# Get the weather for the second day (tomorrow)
tomorrow = data['weather'][1]
print(tomorrow['date'], tomorrow['maxtempC'], tomorrow['mintempC'])

✅ Summary
Whether the format supports multi-day customization and whether the structured data is suitable for program parsing
? format=...	 ❌ (only 1 line) ✅ ❌ (string) ❌
? 3 ✅ (ASCII) ❌ ❌ ❌
? format=j1 ✅ (recommended) ✅ (extract by yourself) ✅ (JSON) ✅

If you need me to help you make a 7-day weather display (table or chart), you can go on saying that I can generate the code for you. Do you want to output in the command line or generate HTML/ charts?
You said:
in the code: for day in data['weather']:
date = day['date']
maxtemp = day['maxtempC']
mintemp = day['mintempC']
description = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value'] # Noon weather
print(f"{date}: {description}, {mintemp}°C ~ {maxtemp}°C")
In it, which line controls the quantity of weather obtained, or where controls the number of cycles
ChatGPT said:

In this code of yours:

for day in data['weather']:

This line is the key to controlling and obtaining the number of weather days.
🔍 Principle description:

data['weather'] is a list, in which each element corresponds to the weather forecast for one day.

"for day in data['weather']" indicates that you need to traverse all the "days" in this list, which determines how many days of weather to obtain.

✅ How to control getting a few days of data?

You can control the number of cycles by slicing. For example, only obtain the weather for the next two days:

for day in data['weather'][:2]: # Only take the previous two days

Obtain the second day (that is, "tomorrow") :

day = data['weather'][1]

📌 Summary:
Sentence meaning
data['weather'] A list of weather conditions for all days (usually 3 to 7 days)
for day in data['weather'] traverse all the days
data['weather'][:n] only traverses the previous n days
data['weather'][1] is obtained separately for the second day (the index starts from 0).

If you want to make the number of days more flexible (user-defined), you can use range() or pass parameters for control, for example:

days_to_show = 3
for day in data['weather'][:days_to_show]:
...

Do you need me to help you change it into a complete program with parameter input?
You said:
But if it's traversal, why did I only obtain data for two days
ChatGPT said:

This is a very crucial issue, indicating that you have realized that the loop itself is fine, but there is not enough data in data['weather']. You only got the weather data for two days. It's not because you loop less, but because the amount of data returned by the API itself is only for two days.
✅ Possible cause analysis
🔸 1.wttr.in returns data for the next two days by default

Although wttr.in typically provides up to three days of data, its behavior may vary slightly depending on the city, request frequency, or server resources.

For example:

Some requests only return 2 days (the length of data['weather'] is 2).

Some requests will return three days.

Free access itself has limitations or load adjustment mechanisms.

🔸 2. You can check the structure of the returned data

It is suggested that you add the following debugging statement to print the length of data['weather'] :

print(f" obtained weather data for a total of {len(data['weather'])} days ")

You can also print the date to see which days it is:

for i, day in enumerate(data['weather']):
print(f" day {i+1} : {day['date']}")

✅ Coping Tips
🔹 Method 1: Re-request to see if the data is restored to 3 days

Sometimes fluctuations in the wttr.in server can lead to less returned data. You can change to another city or try again later:

city = "Shanghai"

🔹 Method 2: Add judgment logic to prevent errors in the program

if len(data['weather']) < 3:
print(" Warning: The API only returned weather data for less than 3 days ")

🧪 Sample code: Automatically check the number of days

import requests

def get_forecast(city):
response = requests.get(f"https://wttr.in/{city}? format=j1")
data = response.json()

days = data.get('weather', [])
print(f" obtained weather data for a total of {len(days)} days ")

for i, day in enumerate(days):
date = day['date']
maxtemp = day['maxtempC']
mintemp = day['mintempC']
description = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']
Print (f "first day {date}, {I + 1} {the description}, {mintemp} ° C ~ {maxtemp} ° C")

✅ Summary
Explanation of possible causes
data['weather'] only has two days. wttr.in only returns two days of data (common)
Incomplete data, limited server response or temporary issues
Requests are too frequent. wttr.in has a frequency limit and may return simplified data
It is rare but exists that cities do not support multi-day forecasts

If you need to stably obtain more weather days (such as 7 days, 10 days), it is recommended to use professional weather apis, such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.com, as they are more stable and reliable.

Do you need me to help you connect to these apis?
